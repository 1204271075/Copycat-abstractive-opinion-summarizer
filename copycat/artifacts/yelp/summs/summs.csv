2JsLzYF8rUalwpm5LDEcog	This place has the best seafood I've ever had. Service is prompt and friendly. The only reason I'm giving it 5 stars is because of their prices.
6C_8Mh4lmLc_QEs3hHleBg	This is a great place to eat if you are in the mood for authentic Mexican food. You can't beat the price                                                                                                                                                                                          ,and the staff is very friendly.

5iHctUjkQTGwEvOaBkwMRQ	This place is awesome! I had the breakfast burrito and it was delicious. The only reason I could give them 5 stars is because it's a little pricey for what you get. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I will definitely be back!
87YsVbCN_kfzheY79Fzjkg	This place is awesome! I had the pleasure of doing my daughter's birthday cake and she did a great job. She was very friendly and made sure we were taken care of. The only reason I'm giving this place 5 stars is because of the price.
3m2XZFVraCiqjgLxHi5MdA	This place is a hidden gem! The food is great and the service is fantastic. Only thing I would say is that it may be pricey                                                                                                                                                                       ,but it's worth the money. It's a must try if you're in the area.
7w99ECXyIR32SKLyMKOLaw	First time using red truck. Did a great job on my handyman                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ,and was very pleased with the results. I would highly recommend red truck to anyone who is looking for a new home in the area.
5mJlO3oCw_4vvbq1qM6OEg	This place is the best sandwich I've ever had. It's a little pricey                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,but you get what you pay for.

-1UMR00eXtwaeh59pEiDjA	This place is awesome! I have been here several times now and have never had a bad meal. The staff is friendly and the food is delicious. I had the eggs Benedict and it was delicious. My only complaint is that it's hard to find parking in the airport.
65GMvjjrsvyR9pxxAys7qg	This place has a great selection of guns and accessories. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because of the lack of organization in the store. I bought a Groupon for my son's birthday and it was a huge waste of money. We will be back.

It's a little pricey for what you get!
#NAME1	This Target is the best!

#NAME2	This is the best BBQ I've ever had.

The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because of how small it is. I would not recommend this place if you're looking for a good BBQ joint.
2jqUYcKMYZXnpxNTkORJgQ	This place is a hidden gem in the heart of Pittsburgh. I have been here twice now and both times the food was delicious. I had the corned beef hash and it was fantastic. The staff was friendly and attentive. Will definitely be back!

86stmK3Vm2f5W6PdyvuLrQ	Food was okay                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,but the service was terrible. I had to ask for a refill on my drink. Never had a problem with them. It's hard to find a place that serves good food.
#NAME4	This place is the best BBQ in the area. I have been here a few times now                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,and the food is consistently good. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I had to wait long for my food to be served. The service was ok                                                               ,but the food was good.

The Bobbie is a must try                                                                                                                                           ,especially if you haven't been here before. It's a little pricy but worth it.
57_msr8gjNakjGO-1f6B_g	This place is the best pho I've ever had. It's a bit pricier than the other pho places                                                                                                                                                                                                            ,but the quality of the food is great.

She was very rude and gave us tips on how to get my drink. I'm not sure what else to say.
5XVabANkehj7oH-Z7YZkwg	This place is the best brunch place I've ever been to. Food is fresh and delicious. Service was great as well. The only thing I didn't like is that it's a little pricey.
7qo6rqDjlHds8ObxzxBD4A	This place is the best pizza I've ever had in my life. The crust was very thin and chewy                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,the sauce was great.

I had the huevos rancheros and it was delicious. Even though it was a little hard to find                                                                                                         ,the service was great. We will be back!

01Ov9eDxKRY5k6ImMdiWLQ	This place is the worst Chinese food I've ever had in my life. Nothing to write home about but the food is good and the service is excellent. If you haven't tried this place yet you'll be disappointed.
8MWiywu09bhLWIpzVaD4gw	Love this place! Great food and service. I'm not a huge fan of the French toast                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ,but I think it's hard to find something that makes me want to come back. It's a little pricy but worth it.
#NAME5	This place is a disgrace. Food is not fresh at all and it's not worth the price. If you're looking for authentic Indian food then this is the place to go.
4nLqlBBt6jcvphkIQxz0gQ	This place is the worst service I've ever had. The food was mediocre at best                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ,and the service was slow. I would not recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a good time at this location. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because of the service.
5k34OJo3BsEaoyMsW86eZg	Hands down the best Mexican food I've ever had in a long time. It's a great place to hang out with friends and grab some drinks. The food is great and the service is great. If you're looking for a quick bite                                                                                   ,this is your place.

7k5F32LULnjplZVQdI4DdQ	It's a sports bar                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ,but the service was great.

6u-x45q0ETB7SQTAAuKSHw	This place is the best Greek restaurant I've ever been to! It's a little pricier than most of the places in Toronto                                                                                                                                                                               ,but the food is delicious. I had the lamb souvlaki and it was delicious. The only downside is that it doesn't take too long to get your food.

806kkDGaRCJ4lZLRcEf-iw	Best ramen I've ever had in a long time.

We had the lobster ravioli and it was delicious. I highly recommend this place.
5WJOM9DefIvLOIrntDIv-A	This place is awesome! I had the Caesar salad with a side of balsamic vinaigrette. Both were delicious and the service was great. Will definitely be back!
#NAME22	I've been eating here for years and have never had a bad experience.

I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to have a great meal.
74C1z6cqEdvJVgETTcEodw	This place is the best Italian restaurant I have ever been to. The food is delicious and the service is great. I had the penne alla vodka pasta and it was delicious! Definitely will be back!
0kPm1zEpeXFRg8D2phqgCQ	This is the worst Dunkin donuts I have ever had in my life. The staff was nice and friendly. However                                                                                                                                                                                              ,the coffee was cold and the coffee wasn't even good. I would not recommend this location if you're looking for a coffee shop.
6jDD-Z8QcsKTdIDWwM8gog	This place has the best Italian food I've ever had. Service was great and the food was delicious. We ordered the eggplant parm and it was delicious! Will definitely be back.
41H6zhehn6vY_b0f2JPuwA	I love this place! I have been getting my lashes done here for years and have always been happy with the results. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I will definitely be back!
7ABOYoF6DeUnX-jTYH14wA	The food was good and the waiter was very friendly. I had the chicken parm and it was delicious. My only complaint was that it was hard to find a place in the area.
0BbRoMwVTZgYV1oqgtsHOw	This place is the worst bar I've ever been to. The bartender was very rude and acted like I was bothering her when I walked in. She did not know how to take care of us. The food was mediocre at best. I'd rather go somewhere else.
0mb-rhWhjrlyiNFGrH_FbQ	I love this restaurant. I have been here several times and have never been disappointed. The food is delicious and the service is great. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a good meal.
50KEvLtQl9Vv4YE1vs681Q	This place is the best Thai food I have ever had. The pad Thai was delicious                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ,and the service was great. I had the chicken and broccoli and it was delicious. Even though it was a little pricey for what you get                                                                                  ,it's a little pricy.
-zuJkmIjdRahT_yHED-62g	Been here a couple of times now. The food is very good and the service is good. I think it's a little pricy                                                                                                                                                                                       ,but it's worth it. My favourite sushi place in Toronto.
0XHMciYfPq7HzEiLCknaCA	This place is the best sandwich I've ever had in my life. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I had the Philly cheese steak and it was delicious. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's a little pricey for what you get.
5PZefPGncZH6AWMqPY2m9g	Been here a few times now and have never had a bad experience. The staff is friendly and helpful. They also have arcade games for kids and adults. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.

0uwQIGlKICIYuRtayVnh7g	If you are looking for a healthy meal then this is the place. It's a chain restaurant with the exception of the food and service. I would not recommend this location to anyone.
4yAvytbVKHqSYAo3mkI9OA	Best Persian food I've ever had in a long time. Everything is fresh and delicious. The owner is very friendly                                                                                                                                                                                     ,even if you don't have to wait.
4c19YWOjPmbFUK4-V2GEvg	The food is decent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ,but the service is terrible. I've been here a few times and each time I get the food. I don't think I'll be back.
1_Dg-GguWatioW4mvFQKQA	This place is the best sushi I've had in a long time. However                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,the service was slow and inattentive. If you're looking for sushi                                                                                                                                                    ,this is the place to go.
